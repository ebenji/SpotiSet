# SpotiSet

So, this project has a funny story behind it. 

I went to a John Mayer Concert in the summer of 2019. I found out that I didn't know too many John Mayer songs after going. I wanted a way to get the concert setlist into a Spotify playlist. This began SpotiSet. 

The goal of the project was to:

1. Input a [setlist](https://www.setlist.fm/)
2. Get all the songs in that setlist put into a Spotify playlist on the users account.

I'm sure one day this will be a full fledged web app, for now it's an MVP.
